## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Obseravations

As the responses of the requests were small, I saw no need to use a BFF in Node.Js to serve the application and I did all the logic of the paginator and requests in angular.
