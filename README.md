# Itiner√°rios Data Poa

An application that helps users retrace all the path of the bus and minibus line using data retrieved from the DATAPOA API

## Get the Code
```
git clone https://github.com/RibarrJR/itineraries_DataPoa

cd itineraries_DataPoa/ 

npm i

```
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Obseravations

As the responses of the requests were small, I saw no need to create a BFF in  Node.Js to serve the application and I did all the logic of the paginator and requests in angular.
